## Overview

The **Adaptive Prompt Optimizer (APO)** is a meta-prompt framework â€” a single text-based protocol that transforms any conversational AI into a systematic prompt-engineering agent.

Unlike libraries or code packages, APO is **purely textual** and **architecture-agnostic**.  
It provides a reproducible reasoning protocol that enables AI systems to:

- Perform structured self-assessment  
- Adapt reasoning depth dynamically  
- Calibrate user granularity and context  
- Construct verifiable, auditable prompts  
- Deliver transparent, confidence-scored outputs  

APO draws conceptually from **cognitive science**, **systems engineering**, and **alignment strategies** common in safe AI design â€” distilled purely through **empirical logic** and **iterative reasoning**.

## Quick Start

1. **Copy** the complete meta-prompt from [`FRAMEWORK.md`](./FRAMEWORK.md).  
2. **Paste** it into any advanced AI system (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini).  
3. **Run** it as the *system prompt* or *base instruction layer*.  
4. **Follow** the AIâ€™s guided calibration process (Phases 0â€“5).

You now have a **self-adaptive reasoning engine** that tailors prompts to verified capabilities and user context.

## How It Works

APO functions as a **phased reasoning architecture**:

| Phase | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **0 â€“ Self-Assessment** | AI verifies its operational capabilities and constraints. |
| **0.5 â€“ User Calibration** | Adjusts reasoning granularity and explanation depth. |
| **1 â€“ Task Profiling** | Builds contextual understanding of task domain and success criteria. |
| **2 â€“ System Identification** | Determines optimal frameworks or tools (with offline fallback). |
| **3 â€“ Method Discovery** | Identifies or infers effective procedural methods. |
| **4 â€“ Prompt Construction** | Synthesizes adaptive, verifiable, and structured prompts. |
| **5 â€“ Delivery** | Outputs optimized prompt with confidence calibration and fallback guidance. |

## Why It Works

APOâ€™s strength lies in **structured adaptability**:

1. **Empirical Verification** â€” All reasoning steps are evidence-based.  
2. **Bounded Adaptation** â€” Never exceeds verified capability without user input.  
3. **Transparency** â€” Each phase and confidence rating is explicit and auditable.  
4. **Governed Loops** â€” Self-auditing is bounded and non-recursive.  
5. **Human-Aligned Clarity** â€” Explanations scale to the userâ€™s expertise.

This ensures **reliable**, **interpretable**, and **reproducible** reasoning across any AI model or environment.

## Conceptual Foundations

- **Cognitive Science** â€” Metacognition, uncertainty modeling, adaptive reasoning.  
- **Systems Engineering** â€” Modular verification loops, constraint feedback.  
- **AI Alignment** â€” Safe reasoning boundaries, corrigibility, interpretability.  

All distilled into a **self-contained textual framework** â€” requiring no dependencies or runtime environment.

## Integration Example

```text
SYSTEM:
Load Adaptive Prompt Optimizer (APO).
Run Phases 0â€“5 sequentially.
Apply governance and confidence calibration at each phase.
Return the final optimized prompt and reasoning summary.

APO can serve as the foundation for meta-agents, research models, or advanced reasoning tools.
```
