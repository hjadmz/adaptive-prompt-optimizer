## What This Is  
  
A meta‑prompt framework: a text template you paste into any conversational AI system to transform it into a systematic prompt optimizer. It’s not software—just text you can copy and paste. It adapts to available capabilities and provides strategic guidance.  
  
## What It Does  
  
When you paste the framework into an AI system, it will:  
  
- ✅ Test available tools before proceeding.  
- ✅ Ask strategic questions only when necessary.  
- ✅ Research approaches when external tools are enabled.  
- ✅ Construct a custom prompt tailored to your task.  
- ✅ Provide confidence scores and reasoning.  
- ❌ Never fabricate or hallucinate information.  
  
The result: **professional, optimized prompts** instead of generic responses.  
  
## Quick Start  
  
1. **Copy the framework**  
   [Open FRAMEWORK.md](./FRAMEWORK.md)` and copy all its contents.  
2. **Paste into any AI**  
   Start any conversational AI and paste the framework.  
3. **Describe your task**  
   For example: “Optimize a prompt for systematic literature reviews,” “Create a prompt for API documentation,” “Build a prompt for market analysis.”  
4. **Follow the process**  
   The AI will walk through the systematic phases and deliver your optimized prompt. Done!  
  
## How It Works  
  
The framework guides the AI through structured phases:  
  
```
PHASE 0: Self‑Assessment       → AI tests available capabilities
PHASE 0.5: User Calibration    → Determines your preferred detail level
PHASE 1: Task Profiling        → Gathers context about your task and goals
PHASE 2: System Identification → Researches potential tools/systems (if enabled)
PHASE 3: Method Discovery      → Finds effective approaches and formats
PHASE 4: Prompt Construction   → Synthesizes an optimized prompt
PHASE 5: Delivery              → Returns prompt with reasoning & confidence
```  
  
Each phase builds on the previous to ensure the AI produces a custom, high‑quality prompt and honestly reports its limitations.  
  
## Examples  
  
- **Academic Writing** – “Optimize a prompt for systematic literature reviews.”  
  The AI checks web access, asks about your field and level, researches review methodologies, and produces a structured prompt for literature analysis.  
- **Technical Documentation** – “Create a prompt for API documentation.”  
  It confirms tool availability, gathers details about audience and complexity, applies documentation best practices, and delivers a clear template.  
- **Business Strategy** – “Build a prompt for competitive analysis.”  
  It verifies available systems, asks about industry and scope, researches strategic frameworks, and outputs a tailored analysis prompt with implementation guidance.  
  
## FAQ  
  
**Do I need to install anything?**  
No. This is a text template. Just copy and paste into a conversational AI.  
  
**What AI systems does it work with?**  
Any AI system that accepts text input.  
  
**Do I need coding knowledge?**  
No. It’s designed for everyone.  
  
**Can I modify it?**  
Yes. It’s released under the MIT License, so you can adapt it for your domain.  
  
**How do I know it’s working?**  
When the AI responds with “PHASE 0: Self‑Assessment…”, the framework is active.
