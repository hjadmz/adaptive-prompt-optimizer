# 🧠 Adaptive Prompt Optimizer (APO)

> A universal meta-prompt framework for structured, adaptive, and verifiable AI reasoning.

**Adaptive Prompt Optimizer (APO)** is a **meta-prompt framework** that transforms any conversational AI into a **self-adaptive reasoning system** — capable of structured self-assessment, confidence calibration, and transparent prompt generation.  

APO combines insights from **cognitive science**, **systems engineering**, and **AI alignment** into a single, reusable text-based reasoning protocol.

## 🧩 Overview

APO is a **research-driven reasoning architecture** that enables AI systems to adapt dynamically to their capabilities and user context.  
It’s **text-only**, **model-agnostic**, and requires **no dependencies**, making it portable and future-proof.

It enables any AI system to:

- Evaluate its **own capabilities and limits**
- Adapt reasoning depth to **user preference**
- Build **verifiable, auditable prompts**
- Calibrate **confidence and uncertainty**
- Produce **transparent, reproducible outputs**

> **APO is not software.**  
> It’s a **structured reasoning framework** that any model can execute entirely through text.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Open [`FRAMEWORK.md`](./FRAMEWORK.md)  
2. Copy the complete meta-prompt  
3. Paste it into your AI system (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)  
4. Run it as a **system prompt** or **instruction layer**  
5. Follow the guided calibration (Phases 0–5)

> Works with any conversational model that supports structured reasoning or system-level instructions.

## ⚙️ Architecture

APO implements a **six-phase reasoning cycle** inspired by human metacognition and control theory:

| Phase | Function |
|:------|:----------|
| **0 – Self-Assessment** | Verify model capabilities and constraints |
| **0.5 – User Calibration** | Match reasoning depth and tone to user preference |
| **1 – Task Profiling** | Define goals, success criteria, and context |
| **2 – System Identification** | Determine available tools or research access |
| **3 – Method Discovery** | Select the optimal reasoning strategy |
| **4 – Prompt Assembly & Delivery** | Generate final adaptive prompt with validation |

---

## 📘 Example Usage

```text
SYSTEM:
Load Adaptive Prompt Optimizer (APO).
Run Phases 0–5 sequentially.
Adapt reasoning depth dynamically.
Return the optimized prompt with a reasoning summary.
```

**Example task:**  
> “Generate a reasoning protocol for evaluating ethical trade-offs in AI systems.”

APO self-assesses, adapts, and delivers a structured, auditable reasoning framework.

## 🧭 Core Principles

### 1. Absolute Rule  
Never fabricate or assume information.  
When uncertain, state it explicitly and propose evidence-based alternatives.

### 2. Self-Assessment  
Models must verify their operational boundaries before reasoning.

### 3. Calibration  
Reasoning depth aligns with user context and model capability.

### 4. Verification  
Every output includes rationale and confidence scoring.

### 5. Governance  
Meta-learning reflexes and loop prevention ensure bounded, auditable reasoning.

## 🧩 Governance Architecture

- **Meta-Learning Reflex** — evaluates reasoning performance post-execution  
- **Learning Boundary Principle** — adapts only within verified capability  
- **Context Refresh Mechanism** — periodically revalidates assumptions  
- **Temporal Abstraction Layer** — separates timeless from time-sensitive logic  
- **Loop-Prevention Protocol** — ensures finite, auditable reasoning cycles  

---

## 💡 Design Philosophy

APO is engineered to remain **valid across AI generations** — from text models to multimodal and agentic systems.  
Its **textual modularity** ensures continued interpretability, testability, and human auditability.

---

## 🧭 Why It Matters

As AI reasoning grows opaque, APO provides a **transparent, testable foundation** for structured cognition.  
It bridges **human epistemic rigor** and **machine adaptability**, supporting research reproducibility and ethical accountability.
