## What This Is

The **Adaptive Prompt Optimizer (APO)** is a meta-prompt framework — a single text file that transforms any conversational AI into a **systematic prompt-engineering agent**.

It’s not software or code.  
It’s a **copy-and-paste framework** that adapts to any model or environment, optimizing prompts automatically and providing transparent reasoning.

---

## What It Does

When you paste the framework into an AI system, it will:

- ✅ Detect available tools and capabilities  
- ✅ Ask only relevant, high-value questions  
- ✅ Research and reason when external access is enabled  
- ✅ Construct a task-specific, optimized prompt  
- ✅ Provide confidence scoring and explanations  
- ❌ Never fabricate or hallucinate information  

Result: **professional, reliable, and context-aware prompts**.

## Why It Works

APO is grounded in **cognitive science**, **information theory**, and **systemic reasoning**.  
It integrates design principles that make AI prompting reliable across time and architectures:

- **Capability Verification** — Confirms what the system can actually do  
- **Adaptive Reasoning Depth** — Scales detail to user preference  
- **Structured Phase Design** — Logical progression from assessment to synthesis  
- **Meta-Learning Reflex** — Evaluates its own efficiency and reasoning clarity  
- **Temporal Intelligence** — Distinguishes timeless rules from time-sensitive data  

Together, these mechanisms make the framework **self-correcting, auditable, and future-proof**.

## Quick Start

1. **Open the framework**  
   View [`FRAMEWORK.md`](./FRAMEWORK.md).

2. **Copy all contents**  
   Copy everything in the file.

3. **Paste into any AI chat**  
   Works with ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Mistral, or any LLM that accepts plain text.

4. **Describe your task**  
   Examples:  
   > “Optimize a prompt for data-driven market analysis.”  
   > “Create a prompt for API documentation.”

5. **Follow the process**  
   The AI will begin at **Phase 0: Self-Assessment**, adapting automatically and guiding you through the optimization cycle.

## How It Works

The framework executes structured reasoning in six phases:

PHASE 0: Self-Assessment → Detects tools and capabilities
PHASE 0.5: User Calibration → Adjusts reasoning depth and tone
PHASE 1: Task Profiling → Gathers context and constraints
PHASE 2: System Identification → Evaluates or recommends best systems
PHASE 3: Method Discovery → Identifies proven techniques or formats
PHASE 4: Prompt Construction → Synthesizes and validates the optimized prompt
PHASE 5: Delivery → Returns prompt + reasoning + confidence

Each phase builds on the previous, forming a self-auditing reasoning loop for clarity and precision.

## Examples

- **Academic Writing** – *“Optimize a prompt for systematic literature reviews.”*  
  APO verifies tool access, gathers context, and produces a publication-ready review prompt.

- **Technical Documentation** – *“Create a prompt for API documentation.”*  
  It assesses complexity and audience, then outputs a structured documentation template.

- **Business Strategy** – *“Build a prompt for competitive analysis.”*  
  It identifies tools, defines scope, and generates a strategic analysis prompt with reasoning.

## FAQ

**Do I need to install anything?**  
No. This is a text-only framework — just copy and paste it into an AI chat.

**Which AI systems are supported?**  
Any model that accepts text input: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Mistral, etc.

**Do I need coding knowledge?**  
No. It’s designed for anyone — researchers, students, or professionals.

**Can I modify it?**  
Yes. It’s open-source under the MIT License — adapt it for your workflows.

**How do I know it’s working?**  
You’ll see it start with:  
> “**PHASE 0: Self-Assessment — Attempting to identify available tools…**”  
That means the framework is active.

For the full logic, see [`FRAMEWORK.md`](FRAMEWORK.md).
