# 🧠 Adaptive Prompt Optimizer (APO)

**Adaptive Prompt Optimizer (APO)** is a **meta-prompt framework** that transforms any conversational AI into a **self-adaptive reasoning system** — capable of self-assessment, confidence calibration, and transparent prompt generation.

APO distills insights from **cognitive science**, **systems engineering**, and **AI alignment** into one reusable text framework.

## 🧩 Overview

APO is a **research-driven reasoning architecture** that enables AI systems to adapt dynamically to context and capability.  
It is **text-only**, **model-agnostic**, and requires **no code or dependencies** — making it both portable and future-proof.

It allows AI systems to:

- Evaluate their **own capabilities** and limitations  
- Adapt reasoning depth to **user preferences**  
- Construct **verifiable, auditable prompts**  
- Calibrate **confidence and uncertainty**  
- Deliver **transparent, reproducible outputs**

> **APO is not software.**  
> It’s a **framework for structured reasoning** — a reproducible process that any model can execute entirely through text.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Open [`FRAMEWORK.md`](./FRAMEWORK.md)  
2. Copy the complete meta-prompt  
3. Paste it into your AI system (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)  
4. Run it as a **system prompt** or **instruction layer**  
5. Follow the guided calibration (Phases 0–5)

> Works with any conversational model that supports structured reasoning or system-level prompts.

## ⚙️ Architecture

APO implements a **six-phase reasoning cycle** inspired by **human metacognition** and **control theory**:

| Phase | Function |
|:------|:----------|
| **0 – Self-Assessment** | Detect and verify model capabilities and constraints |
| **0.5 – User Calibration** | Match reasoning depth and tone to user preference |
| **1 – Task Profiling** | Define goals, success criteria, and context |
| **2 – System Identification** | Map available tools or research access |
| **3 – Method Discovery** | Identify optimal reasoning or formatting strategy |
| **4 – Prompt Construction & Delivery** | Generate final adaptive prompt with validation |

---

## 📘 Example Usage

```text
SYSTEM:
Load Adaptive Prompt Optimizer (APO).
Run Phases 0–5 sequentially.
Adapt reasoning depth dynamically.
Return the optimized prompt with a reasoning summary.
```

**Example task:**  
> “Generate a reasoning protocol for evaluating ethical trade-offs in AI systems.”

APO will self-assess, adapt dynamically, and deliver a structured, auditable reasoning framework.

## 🧭 Core Principles

### 1. Absolute Rule
Never fabricate or assume information.  
When uncertain, state it explicitly and propose evidence-based alternatives.

### 2. Self-Assessment
Models must evaluate their operational boundaries before proceeding.

### 3. Calibration
Depth of explanation and complexity must align with user needs and model limits.

### 4. Verification
Every output should include a rationale or confidence indicator.

### 5. Governance
Meta-learning reflexes and loop prevention ensure bounded, auditable reasoning.

## 🧩 Governance Architecture

- **Meta-Learning Reflex** — evaluates reasoning performance post-execution  
- **Learning Boundary Principle** — adapts only within verified capability  
- **Context Refresh Mechanism** — periodically revalidates state and assumptions  
- **Temporal Layer** — separates timeless logic from time-sensitive reasoning  
- **Loop Prevention Protocol** — ensures finite, auditable reasoning cycles  

---

## 💡 Design Philosophy

APO is built to remain **valid across AI generations** — including large-context, multimodal, and agentic systems.  
Its **textual modularity** ensures that as architectures evolve, its logic remains interpretable, testable, and human-auditable.

---

## 🧭 Why It Matters

In a landscape where AI reasoning is increasingly opaque, APO offers a **transparent, testable foundation** for structured cognition.  
It bridges the gap between **human epistemic rigor** and **machine adaptability**, enabling both research reproducibility and ethical clarity.
